# Problem Set 1

Problem 1
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s. Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', your program should print:
Number of vowels: 5

Problem 2
Assume s is a string of lower case characters. Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in s. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print:
Number of times bob occurs is: 2

Problem 3
Assume s is a string of lower case characters. Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print:
Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh
In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print:
Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc
